Checklists | Microsoft 365 (Office 365) | Study

With the software solution <b>pobvol Open Checklists</b>, your teams can easily and quickly define their own checklists with checkpoints and fields and then use them to transmit the results of checks and other activities to their own SharePoint lists in a structured manner.

<ul>
  <li>Data structures must not be programmed with a lot of effort in databases and lists.</li>
  <li>A Microsoft Power Apps application allows your team to create the necessary fields, checklists, checkpoints, and record the results of checks and other activities.</li>
  <li>All users can customize the checklists, checkpoints, and fields to meet the needs of the team.</li>
  <li>Your users can define fields of type text, number, date, and choice (choices/combobox) and assign them to each checkpoint in a checklist. This ensures flexibility.</li>
  <li>Structured data can also be easily processed and evaluated. This is not so quick and easy with unstructured data from e-mails or text messages.</li>
  <li>Data is stored in your SharePoint environment. I chose SharePoint to keep your license costs as low as possible.</li>
  <li>Microsoft tools and services are used for automation. For example: Power Automate Flow summarizes the sent data in a report and sends it via Outlook to the sender.</li>
